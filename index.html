                        Hello, my name is Nelson Foster. im 29 years old from North-West Ohio, where i was born and Raised.
                         I Currently live in Napoleon, Ohio with my wife, Taelyn Foster, we have a dog named Spud. My work 
                         experience is carpentry but left that field due to injury, which led me to take a leap to learn coding.
                          My top five hobbies are: Camping ,video games, Dungeons and Dragons, audio books, and now learning to code.

                        I have been a carpenter's apprentice for 3 years learning various things from drywall to metal studs. I have learned how to operate a forklift,
                        a boom lift, and a skid steer. I have worked on many big job sites and worked with many contractors over the years having to work
                        independently or as a team. I did large contracting like Promedica job sites all the way to BP refinery doing scaffold. I have had 
                        extensive training in safety and OSHA standards at all job sites as well as working around dangerous conditions.
